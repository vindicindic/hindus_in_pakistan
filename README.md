![Hindu women in Pakistan](assets/collage.jpg)

A detailed dataset has been prepared for cases relating to forced conversion of Hindu girls in Pakistan (especially Sindh that is home to ~94% Hindu population of Pakistan). The dataset has been primarily sourced from Twitter. WHile attempts have been made to capture data as accurately as possible, errors are regretted and any updates or additions to this dataset are welcome and appreciated.

**Master Dataset**: You can access the dataset [here](data/20230131_list_forced_conversions_in_pakistan.xlsx).

**Additional data**: You can also check out photos of victims, perpetrators, FIR documents etc. the `data` folder. Each case in the master dataset is index using a case ID. If there is any additional data for a case (e.g. pictures, documents etc.), you will find a dedicated folder for that case in the `data/forced_conversions_case_data` folder. For example, for case # 9, you will want to look at folder titled `case_9`.
