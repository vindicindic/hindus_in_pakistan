## Dataset on violence / abduction / forced religious conversion of young Hindu girls in Pakistan (especially in Sindh)

<img src="assets/collage.jpg" width="400">

A detailed dataset has been prepared for cases relating to abduction, violence, forced conversion of/on Hindu girls in 
Pakistan (especially Sindh that is home to ~94% Hindu population of Pakistan). The dataset has been primarily sourced 
from Twitter. While attempts have been made to capture data as accurately as possible, errors are regretted and any 
updates or additions to this dataset are welcome and appreciated.

### These attacks happen the most in areas with relatively high Hindu populations.

**Master Dataset**: This dataset called DAAHIP-W (Dataset of Atrocities Against Hindus in Pakistan - Women) contains 
a list of cases that capture critical details about recorded atrocities against Hindu women in Pakistan. You can access 
the dataset [here](data/daahip-w/20230131_list_violence_abductions_forced_conversions_hindu_women_in_pakistan.xlsx).

(Sheet name = DAAHIP-W)  

**Additional data**: You can also check out photos of victims, perpetrators, FIR documents etc. in the `data` folder. 
Each case in the master dataset is indexed using a case ID. If there is any additional data for a case (e.g. pictures, 
documents etc.), you will find a dedicated folder for that case in the `data/forced_conversions_case_data` folder. For 
example, for case # 9, you will want to look at folder titled `case_9`.
